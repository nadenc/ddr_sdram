Mapping design into LUTs...
Running directed packing...
ERROR:Pack:2908 - The I/O component "CLK_N" has an illegal IOSTANDARD value. 
   The IOB component is configured to use single-ended signaling and can not use
   differential IOSTANDARD value DIFF_MOBILE_DDR.  Two ways to rectify this
   issue are: 1) Change the IOSTANDARD value to a single-ended standard. 2)
   Correct the I/O connectivity by instantiating a differential I/O buffer.
ERROR:Pack:2908 - The I/O component "CLK_P" has an illegal IOSTANDARD value.
