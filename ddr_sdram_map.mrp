Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2908 - The I/O component "CLK_N" has an illegal IOSTANDARD value. 
   The IOB component is configured to use single-ended signaling and can not use
   differential IOSTANDARD value DIFF_MOBILE_DDR.  Two ways to rectify this
   issue are: 1) Change the IOSTANDARD value to a single-ended standard. 2)
   Correct the I/O connectivity by instantiating a differential I/O buffer.
ERROR:Pack:2908 - The I/O component "CLK_P" has an illegal IOSTANDARD value. 
   The IOB component is configured to use single-ended signaling and can not use
   differential IOSTANDARD value DIFF_MOBILE_DDR.  Two ways to rectify this
   issue are: 1) Change the IOSTANDARD value to a single-ended standard. 2)
   Correct the I/O connectivity by instantiating a differential I/O buffer.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network BA_IN<1> has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 25 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   BA_IN<0>,
   ADDR_IN<22>,
   ADDR_IN<21>,
   ADDR_IN<20>,
   ADDR_IN<19>
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:159 - Net Timing constraints on signal DDR_CLK are pushed forward
   through input buffer.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
